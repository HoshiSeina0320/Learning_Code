# Offline MDN Docs

If you want resources offline to learn about programming and web technologies MDN is for you!
and I recommend to use MDN over w3school because w3school is outdated.

## full tarball download

Download it offline (2.1gb) at <https://mdn-downloads.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/developer.mozilla.org.tar.gz>

## Third-party toolsSection

Use a documentation browsing app like Dash (macOS) <https://kapeli.com/dash>, Velocity (Windows) <http://velocity.silverlakesoftware.com/> or Zeal (Linux) <http://zealdocs.org/> instead. These apps will help you get the most out of the docs, by providing a search index and quick access to everything you need.

## tip

don't mirror with wget & co, this is putting un-needed pressure on the website and hinders other users. At least make sure <https://developer.mozilla.org/robots.txt> (which asks for gentle throttling) is properly handled. Wget does not handle this for instance (<http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?30999>).

## DevDocs

DevDocs combines multiple developer documentations in a clean and organized web UI with instant search, offline support, mobile version, dark theme, keyboard shortcuts, and more.

DevDocs was created by Thibaut Courouble and is operated by freeCodeCamp.
The JavaScript docs along with most of MDN's web reference pages are available on DevDocs.
The app is open source and can be run offline: <https://github.com/freecodecamp/devdocs>
It's easy to set up and doesn't require scraping MDN.
