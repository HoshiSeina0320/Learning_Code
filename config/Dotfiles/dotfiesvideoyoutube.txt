I've been looking for a better way to manage my dotfiles.  My old method involved moving all of my dotfiles into their own directory and then symlinking each one fo them back into the directory structure.  What a headache!

Using git bare repositories, there is no more moving files into an initialized git repository and then creating symlinks.  Now, I just add, commit and then push.  Done.

Want to make your own git bare repository?  First, make a directory for your new git bare repository (I created one called "dotfiles" but you can name it whatever).

Then I entered the following in the terminal:

git init --bare $HOME/dotfiles
alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME' (add this alias to .bashrc)
bash
config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no

Basic usage example:

config add /path/to/file
config commit -m "A short message"
config push
